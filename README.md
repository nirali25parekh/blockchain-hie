### Abstract
Electronic health records (EHRs) have become an essential part to the healthcare system due to digitalization of health records. The Health Information Exchange (HIE) 
is a centralized system that enables health care providers to access and share these patient EHRs through the internet. They are intended to reduce medical errors, and improve inter-organizational collaboration of patient data across health care institutions. However, current HIEs suffer a number of complications, including privacy concerns, security threats, and a lack of patient control. By putting security and immutability at the core of the system, blockchain technology has the potential to transform healthcare. Owing to its shared ledger structure, it has a permanent audit trail assuring immutability. Through its smart-contract standard, a blockchain-based HIE architecture may improve healthcare records' security, privacy, and interoperability while still ensuring data integrity. The blockchain-based HIE architecture seeks to guarantee data provenance and provide patients with complete ownership over their medical information.
