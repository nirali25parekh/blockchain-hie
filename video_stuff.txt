blockchain is distributed ledger
decentralized
immutable

hie - issues with it, not in some countries

issues with centralized database: hospitals have access
info blockage-what if some hospital does not wish to disclose that info
data corruption-old info, wrong info
needs commission for disclosing 

solution: blockachain
we have the access to my data, we own the data
on decentralized internet


diseases
drugs

product data from manufacturing to customer cannot be corrupted. each stage updates. as a customer we can make sure expiry, each stage

_______________

blockchain intersection between hope and hype

blockchain in healthcare:

perspective of patient

it's trusted-cannot be accessed no backdoor access no tampering
most up to date - updating, maintaining 
no third party

trusted + verified + shared
___________

frauds in traditional and blockchain
identity theft
improbable promises

blockchain vs database

no worry about replication - database

large data sits elsewhere
gdpr -permission key. what can I reveal, what to hide
verify manage control 
committed data implemented through hashing

healthcare: slowest industires who forgot to change
vertical - growing very fast
horizontal - internet blockachain and iot is not

interoperability:
the way different healthcare providers are able to share, search and query medical recordds

1. indentifying patients - same patient data different hospitals + image saved infolder
2. information blocking - policies, hospitals don't wanna lose patients

private blockchain
patients have control over their data
we get request for whoever wants to access your data

VERY NICEEEE

blockachain is set of technologies like a database
data not saved in tables- saved in ledgers
adds a line for any thing-create update etc
uses cryptography

not used immurable-tamer resistant, tamper evident

offchain-stored elsewhere. pointer on the block
onchain-stored with the hash on the block itself



consensus mechanism:


proof of work - uses lots of energy
proof of stake - not much electricity, low latency
proof of elapsed time -
.
.

smart contracts:
creates automation, accuracy, transparency, security, speed


why blochchain?
creates audit trail - 
automatic dynamic consent - patient allows future specific uses of data
(what type of info patient is comfortable sharing)
enables granular protocol permsisions
integrats electronic system: wearables, etc also integrated
tracks drug or device supply chains - every step of the drug supply can be tracked to prevent counterfeir
connects data for deep analytics - single source of data. then any complex analyses (no need for versioning)
unique data privacy capabilities (see video)


what are current use of blockchain in healthcare?

Medical record system - estonia 2016


what are regulatory approaches to blockchain?
HIPAA, GDPR, ...




____________
Plurasight: blockchain-principles and practices

financial and healthcare see benefits of private blockchain
doesn't provide same security as public
comapny decide who can read and verify blocks 
very strict rules -useful for healthcare , finance etc


hash - integrity
hmac - integrity + authentication
digital signature - authrntication + non-repudiation


proof of work - number of 0s we want in the beginning
mining means calculating nonce for the blocks
nonce is used for making sure data is not tampered with(immutable)
strngth in numbers-more people do the mining
incrementing nonce in the (message+nonce) until we get 6 0s in the beginning of hash function


maintaining consensus
Proof of stake:
if two nodes same time
forks created. and longest chain wins -> orphan blocks. 
processed again


why do we need this?
comes down to one word - trust
one of the ig beneifts of blockchain is to get trust on the internet by using decentralization
we've explored how traditiona; banking in business revolves around  having a central authority
blockchain is a great way to centralize these companies so that they are policed and monitored by the participants in the blockchain instead of theat central authority


healhthcare
this is very important in industries like healthcare and finance wo have very strcit rules that they have to adhere to around how visible certain data is

______________


TO RESEARCH ABOUT:
HIE
GDPR


_______

The healthcare system is losing $300 billion each year in poor data integration

blockchain would healthcare offer safe and secure system

only be modified by 
broadcast and verified on peer to peer information
